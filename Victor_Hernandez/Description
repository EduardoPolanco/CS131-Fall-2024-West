My presentation analyzes the critical aspects of Human-Computer Interaction interface between 
Humans and Computers, as well as User Experience, emphasizing their necessity in making human-computer interaction easy and appealing.
This includes coverage of usability, ease of use, and emotional design and includes real-life examples such as 
Amazon's working UX and the poor design of Craigslistâ€™s web pages. 
The presentation also shows the development of such trends as voice interface, augmented reality, 
and moral UX, pointing out the significance of these trends to the future of technology.
By framing these concepts, we would be able to use those same concepts in critiquing the technology that we encounter on daily basis.
